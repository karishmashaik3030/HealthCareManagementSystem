# HealthCareManagementSystem
With increase in demand of hospitals, we need effective data management 
system for handling and storing patient’s data, staff data and treatment details in an 
effective way. HealthCare management system is a web application developed for hospitals 
to manage staff and patient’s data effectively. This project includes registration of patients, 
storing their details into the system, and also computerized billing in the pharmacy and labs. 
HealthCare is a field in which accurate record keeping and communication are critical. The
software has the facility to give a unique id for every patient. It deals with the collection of 
patient’s information. Diagnosis details etc. In order to protect the personal health data
stored on a semi-trusted server, we adopt attribute-based encryption (ABE) as the main 
encryption primitive. Using ABE, access policies are based on the attributes of users or data, 
which enables a patient to selectively share her healthcare among a set of users by 
encrypting the file under a set of attributes, without the need to know a list of users. This 
can help healthcare providers improve patient care, increase efficiency and reduce costs 
while maintaining the highest standards of data security and privacy.
